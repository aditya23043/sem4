gain = 1000
want to stabilize Q point

if you want very high gain you need very high Rc (high load resistor)
	high Rc -> low Vce so Q point not ideal (very cloe to saturation)
	
so we need multi stage amp of gain each about 10
so need 3 amps

speaker will be given (4-6V rating)

use active filter for higher roll off rate (using op amp)
	but op amp has some offsets and introduces some noise in the input signal
	
which frequencies to amplify
20 hz to 20khz has 90% of the power

10% of the power goes to higher and lower frequencies	

can also use a single band pass filter whose 2 cutoff frequencies control bass and treble

will give only one digipot 
have to control the other two parameter using manual potentiometer
bjt: 2N2222

pcb takes 10 days to fabricate
give list of components on friday
