# How to read .svgz (notes) files?
- I use the [Write](https://www.styluslabs.com/) program to take notes using my Huion Inspiroy 2 M Tablet
- And hence, to parse through the .svgz files generated by "Write", you need that software itself
- Download it here -> [Download Write](https://www.styluslabs.com/download/) for your specific OS
- Then, clone the repo with `git clone https://github.com/aditya23043/sem4`
- Go into the repo directory with `cd sem4/`
- Open Write in current directory with `Write .`
- Then select the course whose notes you want to see
- Then select the date corresponding to when the lecture was taken
- And there you go!
