## Strongly Connected Component (see the makeup lecture video)
* Claim: The vertex with a largest departure time is in the source SSC

## Dijkstra's Algorithm
* Single source shortest path

### Assumptions
* Cyclic Graph
* Weight Function should consist of a Real non-negative number

### Applications
* Navigation System
* Routing network
* Plan of actions in a multiple choice problem

### Algorithm
* `dist(v) = min { dist(u) + w(u,v) } for all (u,v) in E`

```pseudo
if(dist(v) > dist(u) + w(u,v)){
	dist(v) = dist(u) + w(u,v);
}
```
Running Time: O(|V|*|E|)

- Start with a source
- Check tense edge from visited vertex set
- Relax such edge
- Include the vertex with the smallest edge

- Recall BFS
	- Uses Queue (FIFO) and returns the shortest path for unit length edge

- We can use a priority queue and that will make the equivalent of Dijkstra
- Functions: ExtractMin(), Insert(), DecreaseKey()
