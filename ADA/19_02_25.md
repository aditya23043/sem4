## Minimum Spanning Tree
- MST of G is a tree T such that it minimizes the three weight such that:
	w(T) := summation of w(e) where e belongs to T
- Is MST always unique for a given G = (V,E,w)?

## CLAIM
- If all the edge weights in a connected graph G are distinct then it has a unique MST
- PROOF: (contradiction)
	- let G has two minimum spanning trees T and T'
	- let e be the min weight edge in T\T' and e' in T'\T.
	- let w(e) < w(e')
	- consider the subgraph T' U {e}
	- the new T' cannot be a tree since it has a cycle because we already had a complete tree from the connected graph G (i.e. it already had (n-1) edges where n is the number of vertices)
	- Let e" be some edge of the cycle that is not in T (may or may not be e')
	- Since e belongs to T and e" != e, so e" belongs to T'\T
	- Hence, w(e) < w(e') <= w(e")
	- Let T" = T' U e\e"
	- Then, w(T") = w(T') + w(e) - w(e") < w(T')
	- But T' was a MST. So it must be w(e") = w(e')
## Types of Edges
- Useless edge: 
	- An edge is considered "useless" if it's not part of any Minimum Spanning Tree (MST) and both its endpoints are in the same connected component of the current spanning forest. 
	- If we add this edge to the current spanning tree, we will get a cycle
- Safe edge:
	- An edge is considered "safe" if it is the minimum-weight edge with exactly one endpoint in some component of the current spanning forest. 
	- Adding a safe edge to the current spanning forest will always result in a subset of an MST. 
	- Also called light edge

## CLAIM
- MST of a graph G contains every safe edge
- Stronger Claim: for any subset S of V, the MST contains the min weight edge with an end in S

T' = T U e \ e'
w(T') = w(T) + w(e) - w(e')

# Jarnik's / Prim's Algorithm
- Start from a vertex and repeatedly add safe edge to T
	- Only adding a safe edge, not a useless edge
- Maintain a priority queue of edges adjacent to T
- Dequeue min weight edges from the queue and check if both end points are in Tree
- If not, then add the end pint of the edge to T and update the priority queue

## Timing Complexity
- O( |E| log(|V|) )

# Kruskal's Algorithm
- Add end points of edges to T in an increasing weight order, if the edge if safe ofc
- Consider a data structure that supports the following operations
	- MakeSet(v)
	- Find(u)
	- Union(u,v)

```pseudocode
Kruskal(V,E):
	sort E by increasing weight			# |E| log(|E|)
	F <- (V,phi)
	for each vertex v E V
		MakeSet(V)
	for i <- 1 to |E|
		uv <- i th lightest edge in E
		if Find(U) != find(V):
			Union(u,v)				# O(log |V|)
			add uv to F
	return F
```

## Time Complexity
- O(E log(V))
