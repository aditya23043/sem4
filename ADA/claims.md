# Divide & Conquer

## Closes Pair in 2D

1. **Claim**: Let p ∈ Q and q ∈ R be a split pair such that d(p,q) = δs < δ. Then, p and q are at most 7/15 positions apart in the sorted list Sy.
	- **Proof**: Contradiction 

2. **Claim**: Let p ∈ Q and q ∈ R be a split pair such that d(p,q) = δs < δ. Then, p and q are from the sorted list Sy.
	- **Proof**:
