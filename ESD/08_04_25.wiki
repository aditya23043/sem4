= ESD LECTURE USART =

* Full Duplex : 2 pins, Rx and Tx
* Half Duplex : 1 pin , Tx
	* Pullup resistor connected so that the pin is kept HIGH in the idle case
	* One pin used for both transmission and reception

* If each data packet validation is very crucial, flow control is needed
* Eg: In a printer, if data is not received instantly, it can be re sent, so flow control not necessarily unlike a MODEM where data packets are very crucial
* R232 hardware flow control / handshaking
	* Extra pins: nCTS, nRTS

* UART and SPI are Push-pull type of pins
* For Half Duplex, since the transmission direction needs to change and the pin shouldnt be left floating even for a `us`, we have a pull up resistor because internal pull up resistors are often weak

* Differential pairs allow us to transmit data over longer distance
* Tx+ connected to Rx+ and Tx- to Rx-
* RS485 communication is very popular
	* It utilizes half duplex mode along with differential pairs if number of cables is a constraint

* Number of bits per second for asynchronous communication
* Data packet width = transmission size / baudrate

* Bit manipulation = manually switching GPIO to mimic a protocol like I2C / USART / SPI / etc. = Bit banding
* PLL used to multiply clocks (Phase Locked Loops)
